# reasonml-community

**Administrator:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward)

This repository contains information about the organization, its purpose and how it works. This document in particular (README.md) is the official agreed-upon documentation of the community. The wiki may hold less-official information and the issues are for discussion and individual opinion.

NOTE: This is not a legal document. Common Sense is required to adequately understand the content herein.

## Purpose

The reasonml-community organization is intended as a home for collectively managed repositories. For repositories that would otherwise be abandoned or sporadically maintained. Community-managed repositories will usually still have a single responsible maintainer, but can more easily be transferred or taken over by another maintainer temporarily or permanently when the need arises, without too much disturbance. Furthermore, the organization provides a beforehand agreed-upon process with clear rules for dealing with various situations, which helps to avoid misunderstandings and disagreements.

The organization itself should also be community-run and -mandated, and transparency should be considered the rule.

## Requirements

### Repository

Repositories to be managed by the reasonml-community organization must fulfill the following requirements:

* All content in the repository MUST be covered by an [FSF](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html)- or
[OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/)-approved license. Esoteric licenses might still be rejected, however.
* The original author(s) and current maintainer(s) MUST either agree to the inclusion, or MUST NOT have made any significant contribution for the past three (3) months.
* A repository SHOULD always have a maintainer, and MUST have a maintainer when first included. The maintainer must be, or become, a community member. See separate requirements for this.
* A repository MAY have collaborators that are not organization members.

### Member

* Members MUST not be dicks
* Members MUST have a role. Members that do not currently have a role should be removed
* Members SHOULD be reachable on Discord
* Members MUST be reachable via an e-mail address shared with the rest of the members
* At least three (3) existing members must approve of memberhsip

## Member roles

### Maintainer

A maintainer is responsible for keeping a repository up to date, being responsive to outside request, and for maintaining the vision and goals of the project. A maintainer may delegate, formally or not, but is ultimately responsible for what goes on in the repository, and for making the boundaries clear when they deviate from the norm.

The current maintainer of the repository should be noted in the repository readme, just below the heading, in the following format:

**Maintainer:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward)

or

**Maintainer:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward) _(interim)_

or

**Maintainer:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward) _(acting, on behalf of [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward))_

### Administrator

The administrator is the maintainer of the meta repository, and the organization as a whole. Any task that is organization-specific, or requires cross-repository coordination falls in the domain of adminstrator responsibility.

The current administrator should be noted in the meta repository readme, just below the heading, in the following format:

**Administrator:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward)

or

**Administrator:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward) _(interim)_

or

**Administrator:** [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward) _(acting, on behalf of [@AnonymousCoward](https://github.com/AnonymousCoward))_

## Process

### Changes to the official documentation

Minor corrections and clarifications can be made directly. Any major change should be raised for discussion in an issue on the meta repository. Strive for consensus. if consensus among members cannot be found, a few people with opposing views should volunteer to investigate the issue thouroughly and try to come to agreement between themselves before presenting their finds. If consensus cannot be reached and a decision must be made, an absolute majority vote among members, present or not, decides.

### Becoming a member

* A member must have a role. Petition to fulfill that role by either makign an issue on the meta repository, bringing it up in Discord, or talking with another member directly.
* Any member can add new members, but must get approval from at least two other existing members.
* If the addition of a new member is disputed, the member who added them must document that the inclusion fulfills the requirements.
* If a member has been added without fulfilling the requirements, the member adding them should be considered a dick and dealt with accordingly.
* If at least three members approved of an inclusion without the requirements being fulfilled, then what the hell are you people doing? SHAME on you, and go read through this document again!

### Maintainer requests to step down

Ideally, the maintainer will not step down until another maintainer has volunteered. However, if that's not possible, another community member should temporarily take over their repsonsibilities until a enw maintainer has been found. The current maintainer is responsible for finding their own replacement by whatever means they deem fit.

### Maintainer is unresponsive

If a maintainer has been unrepsonsive for 7 days, another community member may step in to their shoes. And while normally frowned upon, it is OK to ping other community members to get their attention when this happend. Don't go overboard, though. It's still frowned upon to act like a dick.

If a maintainer has been unpresonsive for 30 days, they should be removed as maintainer and organization member, and may be  eligible for a wiki page of shame or something. Replacement follows the procedure of a maintainer stepping down.

### Member is being a dick

Excommunication by absolute majority vote among members, present or not. Discussion about excommunication, dickiness and other sensitive matters should be made only among members, in private, and is an exception to the rule of transparency.

### Moving a repository to reasonml-community

* Find a maintainer and ensure it otherwise fulfills all the requirements
* If the maintainer is not already a member, have the maintainer go through the process of becoming a member
* Once the requirements are met and the maintainer has become a member, the maintainer may move the repository to the reasonml-community organization.

### Forking an abandoned repository

* A repository may only be forked to the reasonml-community organization after it's considered abandoned
* A repository can be considered abandoned after three (3) months of inactivity with unanswered issues and PRs
* If the repository fulfills these additional requirements, follow the move process.

### Moving a repository to reasonml-community

* If the current maintainer, original author(s) and pre-community-maintainer(s) either  agree, don't care or are unreachable, the current maintainer may move the repository out of the organization.
